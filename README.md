# CarTelemetry

## Goal
Hope to use an RPi, a GPS and a IMU to accurately track a car on the road or track

## Materials
Adafruit Tiny GPS (possibly with different antenna)
Adafruit BNO055 IMU
Raspberry PI 3 (don't need the power of the 4)


## TODO
- Write down vision for project
- Create requirements for board
- List limitations from environment
- Start designing board in Eagle CAD
